<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Video game searching app powered by [rawg.io](rawg.io) api to supply the information about the video games. Integrated a [back-end](https://github.com/Bankhead22/capstone-api) api that allows a user to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. Once signed in, the user is able to add a game to their library. The logic and styling were handled locally on the client through my own code. The design was kept simple to give users an easy experience.

With a minimal design in mind, this [wireframe]() was developed before starting on development. The repository for the back-end can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Bankhead22/capstone-api).
